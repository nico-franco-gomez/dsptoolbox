Filter Banks
------------
This is a collection of useful filters and filter banks.

Perfect magnitude reconstruction:

- `linkwitz_riley_crossovers()`

Perfect reconstruction:

- `reconstructing_fractional_octave_bands()`

Psychoacoustics:

- `auditory_filters_gammatone()`

Other:

- `qmf_crossover()`: Quadrature mirror filters crossover.
- `fractional_octave_bands()`: Butterworth bandpass filter bank with signal
  energy conservation.
- `weightning_filter()`: A- or C-Weightning filter.
- `complementary_fir_filter()`: Create a complementary FIR filter from a
  linear-phase FIR prototype.
- `LatticeLadderFilter()`: Filter with lattice-ladder topology.
- `PhaseLinearizer()`: Design an FIR filter that linearizes a phase spectrum.
- `GroupDelayDesigner()`: Design an FIR filter that matches a target group
  delay.
- `StateVariableFilter()`: SV-Filter discretized with a topology-preserving
  transform.
- `convert_into_lattice_filter()`: Turns a conventional filter into its
  lattice/ladder representation.
- `pinking_filter()`: Get a -3 dB/octave filter.
- `matched_biquad()`: Analog-matched biquad filters.
- `gaussian_kernel()`: IIR first-order approximation of a gaussian window.
