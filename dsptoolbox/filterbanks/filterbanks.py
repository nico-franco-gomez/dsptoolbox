    Parameters
    ----------
    crossover_frequencies_hz : array-like
        Frequencies at which to set the crossovers.
    order : array-like
        Order of the crossovers. The higher, the steeper. See notes for

    sampling_rate_hz : int
        Sampling rate for the filterbank.

    `LRFilterBank`
        Filter bank in form of LRFilterBank class which contains the same
        methods as the FilterBank class but is generated with different
        internal implementations.

    Notes
    -----
    - Only even orders correspond to Linkwitz-Riley crossovers, but odd orders
      are still supported, since they deliver perfect magnitude reconstruction
      as well. Odd orders have band crossing at -3 dB, even orders at -6 dB.
    - All crossovers are butterworth filters except for 2nd order which are
      based on sallen-key filters (Q=0.5) with phase-inverted high band.
    - Slopes:
        - Order -> -x dB / Octave
        - 1 -> -6 dB / Octave
        - 2 -> -12 dB / Octave
        - 3 -> -18 dB / Octave

    """This returns a biquad digital filter (EQ) that is matched to better
    fit an analog prototype than the standard biquad implementation as defined
    in [1]. This is due to the frequency warping that occurs when the frequency
    approaches nyquist. See notes for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eq_type : str
        Type of biquad filter to create. Choose from "peaking", "lowpass",
        "highpass", "bandpass", "lowshelf", "highshelf".
    freq_hz : float
        Characteristic frequency in Hz.
    gain_db : float
        Characteristic gain in dB.
    q : float
        Quality factor. The frequency response differs in its bandwidth from
        the standard biquad implementation due to frequency warping. This
        is specially clear for normalized frequencies higher than 0.2.
        Beware that the implemented shelving filters do not support setting
        a quality factor. Analyzing the resulting magnitude response carefully
        is advised.
    sampling_rate_hz : int
        Sampling rate for the digital filter.
    q_factor : float, None, optional
        Factor by which to scale `q` for peaking filters. This is useful for
        attempting to obtain similar bandwidths as the standard biquad
        implementation in [1]. If None, an approximation formula is used, which
        works well in the gain range [-20, 20] dB and normalized frequency
        [0, 0.2]. With increasing frequency, the warping of the standard
        implementation produces larger errors, so approximating the bandwidth
        there would defeat the purpose of the matching biquad. It always should
        be greater than 0. Default: None.

    Returns
    -------
    `Filter`
        Matched biquad filter.

    Notes
    -----
    Frequency warping generates significant deformations of the frequency
    response of a digital filter near nyquist when compared to the analog
    prototype. These filters alleviate for this at the expense of a more
    involved computation. Using matched biquads is only useful when
    designing filters or filter banks that have normalized frequencies above
    0.15 or 0.2, e.g., above 7.2 kHz for 48 kHz sampling rate.

    The approach used here comes from [2], though there are others. See
    references.

    For shelving filters, [5] is implemented. This implementation does not
    support selecting a quality factor, i.e., q is fixed to `sqrt(2)/2`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel_length_seconds : float
        Kernel length in seconds used to define the width of the gaussian
        bell in relation to time. It corresponds to the time between `t=0` and

        that the filter will be applied (when using zero-phase filtering). The
        higher this number, the better the approximation. This should be
        an even number. Values around 10 will be sufficient in most cases.
