This is a toolbox in form of a python package that handles algorithms to be used in dsp (digital signal processing) projects.

It is a personal project that is under active development and it will take some time until it reaches a certain level of maturity.
If you find some implementations interesting or useful, please feel free to use it for your projects and expand or change
functionalities.

Getting Started
===============

Check out the `examples`_ for some basic examples of the dsptoolbox package
and refer to the documentation for the complete description of classes and methods.

.. note::
    The documentation at `read the docs`_ is available but not working completely without errors
    because of a bug in one of the modules needed to build the package. This will be fixed in the future.
    Until then, please refer to the other available documentation.

Use pip to install dsptoolbox

.. code-block:: console
